#My Dream Vactaion

1. Italy 
    *My dream vacaion has always been at one point to go to italy and explore the historical sites and culture. I also just love italian food.
2. Dubai 
    *The archieture and industrial development of Dubai fascinates me and it is a very lavish city, it seems like a unique experience
3. Tokyo 
    * While Japan is rich culture and tradition it also leads in technological innovation and fashion, that is something I would love to see firsthand
